# Rescue-Robot

Natural disasters are on the rise due to multiple factors, including climate change, earthquakes and forest fires etc. The number of natural disasters has increased exponentially in the last two decades. It is always suggested that rescue operations should be on their toes, when such unfortunate incidents takes place. There some instances were human beings cannot physically perform a rescue operation themselves, mainly due to the fact that it is very dangerous for the rescue team as well. That is where rescue robots can play a pivotal role to minimize the damage caused by the disaster.

While the ultimate goal of rescue robots is to save lives, the motivation for individual robot designs and capabilities is determined by the tasks that they could perform. The following are some of the jobs that have been proposed for rescue robots. A search is a focused action that takes place inside a structure, in caverns or tunnels, or in the outdoors, with the goal of locating a victim or potential threats. The purpose of the search is to be as extensive and early as possible without endangering the victims or rescuers. Reconnaissance and mapping are subsets of search. It provides a basic overview of the situation to rescuers and acts as a reference for the devastation. The goal is to cover a big region of interest quickly and at the right resolution. Robotic machinery or exoskeletons can help remove debris faster. The goal is to carry larger amounts of rubble faster than could be done manually, yet with a smaller footprint than a standard construction crane.
